# Roaming with Excel
# 🚗 Excel Learning Journey: Data Cleaning and Manipulation with `Cars.xlsx`

👋 Welcome to my Excel journey! I’ve been working with the `Cars.xlsx` dataset to sharpen my skills in data cleaning and manipulation. Here’s a breakdown of what I’ve done so far.

---

## 📂 Dataset Overview

The `Cars.xlsx` dataset provides detailed information about **luxury cars** available at a dealership. The key attributes I worked with are:

- **Year**: Manufacturing year of the car.
- **Make**: The car brand or manufacturer (e.g., BMW, Audi).
- **Model**: Specific model of the car.
- **Mileage**: How many miles the car has been driven.
- **Colour**: The exterior colour of the car 🎨.
- **Transmission**: Whether the car has automatic or manual transmission.
- **Owner Count**: Number of previous owners 🚗👥.
- **Price (USD)**: The current selling price.

## 🛠️ Tasks Performed

### 🔧 Data Cleaning
I started by cleaning the dataset to make it more reliable for analysis:

1. **Removed Duplicates**: Used Excel’s `Remove Duplicates` feature to ensure each entry was unique.
2. **Corrected Inconsistencies**: Fixed errors like inconsistent capitalisation of car make and model names (e.g., "BMW" vs "bmw").

### 🔀 Data Manipulation
Next, I applied several Excel techniques to explore the dataset:

1. **Sorted Data by Year**: Analysed age-related price depreciation by sorting the cars based on their manufacturing year.
   
2. **Calculated Averages**: Used the `AVERAGE` function to compute average prices by car make and model for market comparison.

## 🔍 Insights Gained

Here are a few key insights I discovered from the dataset:

1. **Most Popular Colour**: 
   - **Black** was the most popular colour among the luxury cars in this dataset.
   
2. **Price vs. Ownership**: 
   - Cars with fewer previous owners tended to have a higher average price.

## 🎯 Conclusion

This exercise greatly improved my **Excel skills**, especially in these areas:

- **Data Cleaning**: Removing duplicates and fixing inconsistencies.
- **Data Manipulation**: Sorting data, calculating averages, and filtering information for analysis.

I’m excited to continue this journey and explore more advanced Excel features! 📈
